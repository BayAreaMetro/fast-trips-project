#### ----DRAFT----

As a former agency employee, I know how hard it is to get the paperwork stars to align
so you can actually start work.  When you add in multiple agencies in multiple states along
with a Federal agency working via a State DOT and research university...things got dicey.

This post is a summary of "how we got everybody signed on" in case anybody else needed an
 example to point to for their own work that *works*...and in case anybody who has the power
  to make it simpler has the power to make it easier.

#### Why did we decide to collaborate?

The first question you might want to know the answer to is *why in the world would you try this?*

Fair enough.  Here are a few of the reasons:

1. Each agency adds unique value and staff capabilities:
  * [SFCTA](http://www.sfcta.org/modeling) had [experience with using a grant to develop a dynamic 
  network model](www.github.com/sfcta/dta) and had tested Fast-Trips in-house.
  * [MTC](http://www.mtc.ca.gov), as an MPO, had the ability to contract directly with FHWA in response to this RFP and 
  wanted to learn from [SFCTA](http://www.sfcta.org/modeling)
  * [PSRC](http://www.psrc.org) brought staff power, software development leadership, and another state/region
  * [University of Texas Network Modeling Center](http://ctr.utexas.edu/nmc) had the original Fast-Trips developer
  in-house and experience in using it for planning projects.
2. The more agencies with skin in the game, the more likely broad adoption will be.
3. The more regions and situations the product is tested in, the more likely it is to work for other places. 
4. The more staff we can put on this project, the more resilient the schedule will become.  If one agency
is pulled into a fire drill, the other can come in and help it out.
5. We all anticipate learning from how other agencies do things and get things done.  Both technically and institutionally.

I think at the end of the day, the fact that we all knew each other and had and immense amount
of trust and respect for each other was what sealed the deal.  

#### The Application

When FHWA released the request for proposals, we all brainstormed both internally and
in small groups potential projects.  Something that was key was that the proposal was required 
to be "agency-led"...and not just any agency, it had to be a state DOT or MPO.

I believe that the agency-led process is key, and shows:

* internal commitment to the project's long-term success
* the importance of this project to solving one of the agencies problems
* commitment to solving the problem, not just implementing "a solution" that might not be quite right

More importantly, public agencies aren't profit-maximizing and can be incentivized to collaborate
if they believe the outcome will be better for their agency.  Even though FHWA had set the 
grant level at the same maximum regardless of how many agencies had signed on, we thought we
had a better chance together than apart.

We have posted a [full copy of our grant application]({{ site.baseurl }}/library/C10_MTC_Application.pdf).

#### We won!  Now can we start work?

Not so fast.  Even though we were notified in Summer 2014 that we had won the grant, there 
were a number of next steps that would need to happen before we were allowed to kick-off in 
January 2015.

A summary of these is as follows:

1. FHWA to MTC Funding Agreement
2. Deliverables-based MTC to SFCTA Funding Agreement
3. Deliverables-based MTC to PSRC Funding Agreement
4. Deliverables-based MTC to UT Austin Funding Agreement

#### Issue resolution framework

With so many agencies, we also thought it was going to be important to write out explicitly
how we would resolve any disputes that we couldn't resolve by consensus:

	Agreement should be made by consensus. If the majority of the Management Team reaches 
	agreement at the end of the week time-frame, the proposal and any changes will be 
	considered “accepted,” or “accepted, with adjustments.” If sufficient response has not 
	been received, or there are areas of disagreement among the Management Team, the 
	Technical Lead or Project Manager will convene a discussion in order to try and reach
	 an agreement. If the Management Team fails to reach consensus at the end of this 
	 discussion, there will be a vote whereby majority of the Management Team (comprised 
	 of David Ory, Joe Castiglione, and Billy Charlton or their proxies) will rule.

#### Drawbacks

There are a number of drawbacks to this approach, the primary one being the incredible
amount of time that the funding agreements took to create, agree upon, and execute.  This
is seen in the amount of time it took from when we were notified of the success of our application,
and the time when we had our kick-off meeting:  six months.  Moreover, any time we change
the roles and responsibilities of any agency, we have to execute a contract modification.
