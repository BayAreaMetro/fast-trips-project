This past Summer, the Tri-Agency Team has shifted gears away from estimating a route choice model with observed data towards and “assert and calibrate” approach.  This shift was motivated by our desire to have a model ready for application at the end of this project and informed by both a more detailed review of the observed data as well as our investigation into [methodological challenges of dynamic passenger route choice]({{ site.baseurl }}/library/TRB17-Issues.pdf) estimation.  We are not leaving these challenges behind, but rather forking the project into two prongs so as to not put solving them on the critical path to having a model that is ready to use.  

The “Applications Track” of work is focused on standing up the Fast-Trips model such that it can be used in projects by agencies.  This track’s plan, as denoted in the memo [*Developing and Applications-Ready Route Choice Model*]({{ site.baseurl }}/library/DevelopinganApplication-ReadyRouteChoiceModel.pdf), is to first develop a set of performance targets and calibration tools to allow the team to efficiently identify and remedy issues.  Subsequently, the plan is to complete three phases of calibration.  Phase I focuses on making sure Fast-Trips makes sense at the individual trajectory level when compared with the on-board survey and California Household Travel Survey GPS data.  Phase II will then scale this to full Bay-Area Fast-Trips runs and comparisons to route level and screenline-level validation data.  Phase III will include a full Bay Area validation when integrated within the SF-CHAMP travel demand model and run with feedback.

The “Research Track” of the workplan will focus on defining and prioritizing the problems at hand for researchers and developing a set of test cases that researchers might use in order to explore the problems and validate any solutions.  This work, which is detailed in the Memo [*Research Track Workplan*]({{ site.baseurl }}/library/ResearchTrack-PublicWorkplan.pdf), will be undertaken in conjunction with researchers in the field in order to more accurately understand the methodological gaps and more meaningfully frame a roadmap for remedying them.

We have spent the past Fall completing work on the performance targets and calibration tools and working through the Phase I calibration as described in the memo as well as a procurement to create a bench of researchers who will comprise our research advisor panel for the research track.  We look forward to sharing the Phase I calibration process and what we have learned thus far in a forthcoming post.
