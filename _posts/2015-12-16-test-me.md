Good news â€“ we just [put up some instructions](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/fast-trips/tree/develop) 
and sample data for you run Fast-Trips at home!  

The basic requirements are:

 * [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) ( or equivalent ) installation of Python
 * Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 (e.g. [for Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266) )
 * [TransitFeed](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/TransitFeed) for reading GTFS data

We have included a small, five-zone test network [ located in the subdirectory 
`\Examples\test_network` ] to facilitate tinkering with and testing various features before 
instituting a full-scale run.

Nothing is perfect, but we would love to know what you think!  Please submit issues to our 
[GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/fast-trips/issues).  The 
more people who try it out now, the better and more usable it will be later.
