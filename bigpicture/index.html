                                        urban transit systems have struggled to meet their service standards
                                        for both reliability and capacity provision.  For example, San Francisco's Muni system is
                                        quite crowded, with official reports showing that 
                                        <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/FY11-FY12ServiceStandardsFINAL.pdf">
                                        over 5% of peak period travel happens on transit lines
                                        that are over 125% of their peak load capacity.</a>  The passenger experience
                                        is further degraded by the unevenness of the vehicle arrivals as <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports/2015/Strategic%20Plan%20Metrics%20Report%20-%20April%202015%20FINAL.pdf">
                                        only 6 out of 10 arrive within a few minutes of their scheduled headway </a>.
                                        As a result, people are turned away from traveling on 
                                        transit and on to congested roadways both because they cannot physically get on and 
                                        because it can not reliably get them to work, appointments, or home.

                                       The historical emphasis of studying and planning-for vehicle-travel rather than person-travel
                                       has resulted in a multitude of heavily-researched and widely-accepted technical tools to support vehicle-travel, but few
                                       if any to analyze transit reliability and capacity. Following the adoption of the San Francisco Transportation Plan 
                                       and Plan Bay Area, planners and policy makers applied for and won two significant grants to address this disparity ahead
